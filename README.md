# FermiHubbardDMRG
This analysis heavily relies on the work carried by me and my friend mrc-pop on the Bose-Hubbard model, which you can find at his repo: https://github.com/mrc-pop/BoseHubbardDMRG. Here I employ a similar analysis over the 1D spinless Fermi-Hubbard model, with the aim of using bosonization techniques to study both the phase diagram and the Luttinger liquid parameters; comically, after a lot of work, I realize my code is not so good and neither are my data. The final takeaway is some analysis on CDW/SU phase transition in the one-dimensional model.

The repo is organized in two folders: `Project`, containing all the code, data and plots; and `Report`, containing all the source code I used for the report I produced for the exam. I have promised myself I will document completely this repo, with precise instructions on how to use everything - now it is a matter of seeing if this I will actually do. Anyways, enjoy!

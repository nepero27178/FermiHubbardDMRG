\section{Algorithms and simulations}

This section is devoted to delineate the system properties we aim to simulate. The algorithm used is finite-size DMRG, implemented in the \href{https://docs.julialang.org/en/}{\texttt{Julia language}} via the well supported \href{https://itensor.github.io/ITensors.jl/stable/index.html}{\texttt{ITensors.jl}} \href{https://itensor.github.io/ITensorMPS.jl/stable/}{\texttt{ITensorsMPS.jl}} packages.

\subsection{General strategy and target(s)}

Our final aim is to extract the Bosonization parameters $u$ and $K$ for the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model of Eq.~\eqref{eq:spinless-hamiltonian-pbc}. For the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ system, the expected phase transition is from a ferromagnetic state to a state dominated by spin fluctuations. \todo

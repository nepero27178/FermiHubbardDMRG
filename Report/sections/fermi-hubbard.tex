	\caption{In Fig.~\ref{subfig:lattice-ring} a schematics of a $1D$ closed lattice is portrayed. The hopping amplitude $t$ is purely real, $t = \sgn(t) \abs{t}$. In Fig.~\ref{subfig:lattice-ring-flux} the same lattice is represented, but coupled to a finite threading flux $\Phi$ which can be absorbed via the pseudo-gauge transformation in Eq.~\todo. As a consequence, the hopping amplitude acquires a chirality which manifests in a non-null imaginary part, $T = t e^{i\Phi/L}$.}

\end{figure}

In this project I limit myself to a polarized (spinless fermions) system. Extension to a spinful system is possible and introduces some refinements in the general bosonization scheme, the most notable being the famous spin-charge separation. Let me take it easy: consider the following interacting hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spinless-hamiltonian-pbc}
	\hat H \equiv -t \sum_{\ev{j,k}} \left[
		\hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_k + \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_j 
	\right] + V \sum_{\ev{j,k}} \hat n_j \hat n_k - \mu \sum_{j=1}^L \hat n_j
\end{equation}
defined on a closed $1D$ lattice ring, as in Fig.~\ref{subfig:lattice-ring}.
This is a simple nearest-neighbors (NN) interacting lattice hamiltonian with NN interaction $V$, chemical potential $\mu$ and hopping amplitude $t$,
\[
	t, V, \mu \in \mathbb{R}
\]

I will also be considering a magnetic flux $\Phi$ threading the ring and coupling to the charge degree of freedom. On a ring this pinned flux acts as a tangential vector potential, which is, a momentum offset; thus the correct way to absorb into our lattice framework this interaction is via the pseudo-gauge transformation
\[
	\hat c_j \to e^{-ij \phi} \hat c_j
	\qquad\qquad
	\hat c_j^\dagger \to e^{ij \phi} \hat c_j^\dagger
	\qquad\qquad
	\phi \equiv \frac{\Phi}{L}
\]
Incorporate the latter in the above hamiltonian: the hopping amplitude becomes complex (which is, chiral) $t \to T \equiv t e^{i\phi}$, with $t, \phi \in \mathbb{R}$. We have, as in Fig.~\ref{subfig:lattice-ring-flux}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:spinless-hamiltonian-tbc}
	\hat H \equiv -t \sum_{j=1}^L \left[ 
		e^{-i\phi} \hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_{j+1} + e^{i\phi} \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j 
	\right] + V \sum_{j=1}^L \hat n_j \hat n_{j+1} - \mu \sum_{j=1}^L \hat n_j
\end{equation}
where a $\mod L$ operation is intended: $L+1 \leftrightarrow 1$. I want to indagate its ground-state properties. The relevant parameters will be the reduced interaction $V/t$ and chemical potential $\mu/t$.
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		V/t &> 0 \qquad
		&&\text{Repulsive interaction} \\
		V/t &< 0 \qquad
		&&\text{Attractive interaction} \\
	\end{aligned}
\]
Intuitively, if the interaction becomes dominant with respect to the hopping dynamics, the combined effect of attraction/repulsion and Pauli exclusion principle should lead to two different forms of localization. On one hand, if the interaction is strong and attractive, the ground state should be uniformly filled, because fermions save energy both by closed packing and by increasing density due to the negative chemical potential contribution ($\mu > 0$). On the other hand, a strong repulsive interaction could lead to an half-filled chain, which sacrifices the chemical potential energy gain lost by reducing the particle number by not paying the energy cost of having nearby fermions. In both cases hopping is suppressed, thus fermions are localized; now it is a matter of seeing if these states are actually realized.

\subsection{Jordan-Wigner mapping of the Heisenberg XXZ model}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pictures/fermi-hubbard/jordan-wigner-mapping}
	\caption{Schematics of the Jordan-Wigner mapping. The above chain represents the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ model, while the chain below represents the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model. Hollow circles represent holes, filled circles represents on-site particles. In both chain the two competing processes are represented: the NN interaction and the swapping interaction.}
	\label{fig:jordan-wigner-mapping}
\end{figure}

The model presented above can be obtained rather easily through a Jordan-Wigner of the Heisenberg XXZ model in transverse field,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xxz-hamiltonian}
	\hat H_\mathrm{XXZ} \equiv \sum_{\ev{j,k}} \left[
		J_{xy} \left( 
			\hat S_j^x \hat S_k^x + \hat S_k^y \hat S_j^y
		\right) + J_z \hat S_j^z \hat S_k^z
	\right] - h \sum_{j=1}^L \hat S_j^z 
\end{equation}
The Jordan-Wigner mapping, only feasible in one dimension due to sites ordering, is given by:
\[
	\hat S_j^+ \to \hat c_j^\dagger e^{i\pi \sum_{k < j} \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k}
	\qquad
	\hat S_j^- \to \hat c_j e^{- i\pi \sum_{k < j} \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k}
	\qquad
	\hat S_j^z \to \hat n_j - \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2}
\]
Notice the appearance of the Jordan string,
\[
	e^{i\pi \sum_{k < j} \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k} = (-1)^{\zeta_j}
	\qquad
	\zeta_j \equiv \sum_{k < j} \hat n_k
\]
Essentially, the above string counts the fermions \textit{before} the site in question and gives back a factor $+1$ for even number, $-1$ for odd number. This works for open-ends chains, where the concept of \textit{before} is actually well-defined. It is straightforward to see:
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		S_{j+1}^+ \hat S_j^- &\to (-1)^{\zeta_{j+1}+\zeta_j} \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j = (-1)^{n_j} \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j = - c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j \\
		S_{j+1}^- \hat S_j^+ &\to (-1)^{\zeta_{j+1} \zeta_j} \hat c_{j+1} \hat c_j^\dagger = (-1)^{n_j+1} \hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_{j+1} = - c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j \\
	\end{aligned}
\]
having used $\zeta_j + \zeta_{j+1} = 2 \zeta_j + n_j$.
Let me take a $1\mathrm{D}$ spin chain with open boundary conditions (OBC). The transformation gives
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		\hat H_\mathrm{XXZ} &\equiv \sum_{j=1}^{L-1} \left[
			\frac{J_{xy}}{2} \left( 
				\hat S_j^+ \hat S_{j+1}^- + \hat S_j^- \hat S_{j+1}^+
			\right) + J_z \hat S_j^z \hat S_{j+1}^z
		\right] - h \sum_{j=1}^L \hat S_j^z \\
		&= \sum_{j=1}^{L-1} \left[
			- \frac{J_{xy}}{2} \left(
				\hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_{j+1} + \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j
			\right) + J_z \left(
				\hat n_j - \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2}
			\right) \left(
				\hat n_{j+1} - \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2}
			\right)
		\right] - h \sum_{j=1}^L \left(
			\hat n_{j} - \frac{\mathbb{I}}{2}
		\right) \\
		&= \sum_{j=1}^{L-1} \left[
			- \frac{J_{xy}}{2} \left(
				\hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_{j+1} + \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j
			\right) + J_z \hat n_j \hat n_{j+1}
		\right] - \sum_{j=1}^L h_j \hat n_{j}
		+ \frac{hL}{2} + \frac{J_z (L-1)}{2}
	\end{aligned}
\]
where I defined:
\[
	h_j = \begin{cases}
		h + J_z/2 &\qq{if} j=1,L \\
		h + J_z &\qq{if} 1<j<L
	\end{cases}
\]
Apart from a constant energy shift, in the bulk ($1<j<L$) this is the spinless fermions hamiltonian in Eq.~\eqref{eq:spinless-hamiltonian-pbc} with the following maps:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xxz-fermions-parameters-map}
	t = \frac{J_{xy}}{2}
	\qquad
	V = J_z
	\qquad
	\mu = h + J_z
\end{equation}
A schematics of the mapping is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:jordan-wigner-mapping}.

Now, add another site. This amounts for extra terms in the hamiltonian,
\[
	\hat H_\mathrm{XXZ} \to \hat H_\mathrm{XXZ} + \frac{J_{xy}}{2} \left( 
		\hat S_L^+ \hat S_{L+1}^- + \hat S_L^- \hat S_{L+1}^+
	\right) + J_z \hat S_L^z \hat S_{L+1}^z
\]
In order to identify the open ends, which is, close the chain onto itself, the condition is
\[
	\hat S_{L+1}^\alpha = \hat S_1^\alpha
\]
The first-site Jordan-Wigner string is trivial, $\zeta_1 = 0$. The implementation of periodic boundary conditions requires in operator space then $\zeta_{L+1} \to \zeta_1 = 0$. Finally, it is trivial to see
\[
	(-1)^{\zeta_L} \hat c_L^\dagger = (-1)^{\#_F} \hat c_L^\dagger
	\qquad
	(-1)^{\zeta_L+1} \hat c_L = (-1)^{\#_F} \hat c_L
\]
with $\#_F$ the total number of fermions on the chain. Putting all together, as long as $\#_F$ is \textbf{even} {\color{tabred}[Check: I have the suspect it should be odd, actually...]}, we can impose periodic boundary conditions,
\[
	\hat S_1^+ \hat S_L^- = - \hat c_L^\dagger \hat c_1
	\qquad
	\hat S_1^- \hat S_L^+ = - \hat c_1^\dagger \hat c_L
\]
Simpler reasoning holds for the $z$ terms. Putting all together, the PBC-$\mathrm{XXZ}$ model is mapped onto a spinless fermionic system on a ring with even number of particles, with the rules of Eq.~\eqref{eq:xxz-fermions-parameters-map}. Since the PBC-$\mathrm{XXZ}$ admits for an exact Bethe-Ansatz solution, we can link the phase transitions of the two models.

\subsection*{Phase diagrams}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pictures/fermi-hubbard/xxz-phase-diagram}
	\caption{Schematics for the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ model phase diagram. We are here considering a zero-field model, $h=0$ (which is mapped by the maps \eqref{eq:xxz-fermions-parameters-map} to a $\mu = J_z$ model). H indicates Heisenberg, I indicates Ising; F stands for Ferromagnet, AF for Anti-Ferromagnet; XY stands for pure $\mathrm{XY}$ model. The color of each label recalls the dominant interaction of Fig.~\ref{fig:jordan-wigner-mapping}.}
	\label{fig:xxz-phase-diagram}
\end{figure}

The phase diagram of the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ model is readily obtained by the means of exact methods like Bethe Ansatz. Of course, the dominant parameter is the ratio $J_z/J_{xy}$ which measures the dominant contribution to energy given by spin-spin NN interaction ($z$ term) and spin diffusion ($xy$ term). Whenever $\abs{J_z} = \abs{J_{xy}}$, the model is of the Heisenberg class.

The basic, field free phase diagram is represented schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:xxz-phase-diagram}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system tends to an Ising Ferromagnet for $J_z / J_{xy} < -1$, with dominant behavior the complete alignment of spins (which maps onto the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model as a completely filled chain). 
	\item Moving across the first Heisenberg boundary, $J_z = - J_{xy}$, the dominant behavior is spin diffusion up to a perfect local fields free situation of $J_z = 0$. This phase maps onto the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model as a superconducting phase.
	\item Crossing the second Heisenberg boundary, $J_z = J_{xy}$, the system tends to an Ising Anti-Ferromagnet, dominated by the Néel state configuration. The latter maps onto an half-filling and Mott-localized fermionic chain.
\end{enumerate}
For a fixed number system, this is the expected phase dynamics.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pictures/fermi-hubbard/xxz-field-phase-diagram}
	\caption{Schematics of the phase boundaries for the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ model as extracted by \citeauthor{rakov2016symmetries} \cite{rakov2016symmetries}. Notice the two zero-field phase-transition points $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$.}
	\label{fig:xxz-field-phase-diagram}
\end{figure}

Now, define $J$ and $\Delta$ as in \cite{rakov2016symmetries}, which is
\[
	J_{xy} \equiv -J
	\qquad\qquad
	J_z \equiv -J\Delta
\]
Notice that I set $J > 0$, while $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}$. This is because a simple canonical transformation (at zero field) of the fermionic operators (specifically, a $\pi$ shift in momentum) inverts the $xy$ coupling sign leaving unchanged the $z$ coupling. Then I may limit to $J>0$. This gives the mapping:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:xxz-fermions-parameters-map-2}
	t = - \frac{J}{2}
	\qquad
	\frac{V}{t} = 2\Delta
	\qquad
	\frac{\mu}{t} = - 2 \left(
		\frac{h}{J} - \Delta
	\right)
\end{equation}
Within this parametrization, the analytical phase diagram is the one depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:xxz-field-phase-diagram} \cite{rakov2016symmetries}.
Now, I use $\mu/t > 0$. This maps on the $\mathrm{XXZ}$ model as $h/J < \Delta$, a condition depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:jordan-wigner-mapping}. Thus, running simulations in a regime $\mu/t > 0$ and $V/t \in \mathbb{R}$, what one expects is to encounter all three phases. Now, I need to reconnect this expectation in a bosonization framework.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pictures/fermi-hubbard/jordan-wigner-phase-diagram}
	\caption{The same phase diagram as in Fig.~\ref{fig:xxz-field-phase-diagram}, completed with the requirement $h/J < \Delta$. The shaded area is excluded from the mapping. Note that a positive chemical potential excludes the Antiferromagnetic phase.}
	\label{fig:jordan-wigner-phase-diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Non-interacting ground-state}

In order to further explore the interacting system, we need to know its zero-field non-interacting ground-state. This amounts to setting $V=\mu=0$. The hamiltonian is well known,
\[
	\hat H_0 = -t \sum_{j=1}^{L} \left(
		\hat c_j^\dagger \hat c_{j+1} + \hat c_{j+1}^\dagger \hat c_j
	\right)
\]
and is easily solved by a simple Fourier transformation,
\[
	\hat c_j \equiv \sum_k e^{ikj} \hat c_k
\]
(I am here using adimensional momenta $k$, since space has throughout been considered as a simple integer index) which leads to
\[
	\hat H_0 = -t \sum_k \left[
		e^{-ik} \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k + e^{ik} \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k
	\right] = \sum_k \epsilon_k \hat c_k^\dagger \hat c_k
	\quad\text{for}\quad
	\epsilon_k = -2t \cos k
\]
The band $\epsilon_k$ is represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:XY-band}. At half-filling, this simple sinusoidal band presents a null Fermi energy at Fermi wavevector $k_F = \pm \pi/2$. Linearization of the band for subsequent bosonization is as well represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:XY-band}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{pictures/fermi-hubbard/XY-band}
	\caption{Excitations band and relative linearizations for the non-interacting model ($V=0$). At half-filling the ground-state has null Fermi energy, the negative part of the band is filled and the spectrum is gapless.}
	\label{fig:XY-band}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bosonization of the model}

I now \textit{bosonize} the spinless Fermi-Hubbard model. Recall the processes of Fig.~\ref{fig:g-processes}: for a spinless system the only contributions to a bosonized hamiltonian is from the $g_2$ and $g_4$ processes. The non-interacting hamiltonian is very simple, and it already known how to reduce it to the form of Eq.~\eqref{eq:free-field-hamiltonian}: all is needed is to take a coherent continuum limit for the fermionic operators,
\[
	\hat c_j \to \hat \psi(x)
\]
We derived Eq.~\eqref{eq:free-field-hamiltonian} starting from a free-fermions situation, a condition which has led us to the appearance of the Fermi velocity $v_F$. Of course, a tuning of the hopping parameter $t$ in our lattice hamiltonian besides its free-particles kinetic values in the continuum limit could in principle give us another velocity (with respect to the respective free-fermions value). This amounts for a fermion mass tuning. \todo
